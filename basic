0.GUI (graphical user interface) such as file finders 
eg  sed 's/dude/Colt/g' report.txt > report_new.txt  //sed:search and pop it to report_new

Be familiar and confortable with command line

file structure is a tree, all relative to a base ROOT director
 root/
 
each additional level down adds a "/"
absolute path /Users/colt  // abs path always start with a / --which stands for the root
 
 
by default is at home directory and represent as "~"
 
 pwd : print working directory
 cd : change directory
 
 
type python3 to go into python3, otherwise is python  --2
 
use touch to create a new .py file 

print("hello world") 
//don't need the semi colon at end

1.variables must stary with a letter or underscore_
  CASE sensitive!!

2. ** power
   % remainder
   /  不是整数除法，就是正常的除 （in python 3） python2 和 c++一样还是整数除法
 
  x = 1 + 2**3/4*5  
  print(x)  //1+8/4 *5 =1+2*5 =11.0
  
1+1.0 // 2.0 - to float automatically

// --- Interger Division
5//3   #1
10//3  #3 (always round down)

1/2   #0.5 python always get float

2**3  #8

49**0.5 #7

13%2  #1

  
3.constans:fixed vlues such as numbers, letters and strings are constants
  string constants use single quotes ('') or double quotes ("")


4. try/except -- traceback
try 里面任意一个die了直接走except，不会继续走下面的了--利用try来尝试危险，catch errors
astr = ‘hello bob'
try:
  ister = int (astr)
except: 
  ister = -1   // usualy provide hints for where is wrong, can add a quit here
  
5.
name = input('who are u?) // the input() will return a string
print ('welcome', name)  // the comma will creat a space

6. use # for comments in python

7. python use indent to distinguish block, which is 4 spaces, it is better to use space than tab, to avoid difference between different editors

8. python 里的print（） 有自动换行功效
use --type(9)
will show the type of it, can be a variable name

9.
python documentation ---docs.python.org
Give you information about python stuff--make sure to check the python3 documents

''' for python  multiple line comments

#the naming convention of python is s_n_a_k_e

#you don't need to declare the type of variables

nums_of_casts = 99 
nums_of_casts * 2  #nums_of_cats doesn't change
all, at, once = 5, 10, 15 

#you can always assign and reassign variables
