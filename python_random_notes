1.variables must stary with a letter or underscore_
  CASE sensitive!!

2. ** power
   % remainder
   /  不是整数除法，就是正常的除 （in python 3） python2 和 c++一样还是整数除法
1+1.0 // 2.0 auto do the float convert for you 


// --- Interger Division
5//3   #1
10//3  #3 (always round down)


1/2   #0.5 python always get float

2**3  #8

49**0.5 #7

13%2  #1


3. naming_conventions

most variables should be lower case,
CAPITAL_NAME usually is constants
UpperCamelCase : refer to a class

"dunder" for double underscore ***
   
4.string format
interpolate  #插入
f-strings (python 3.6+)
x = 10 
formatted = f"I told you {x} times!" #不可以忘了这个f！
#you can also do math in the {}

# in python 2 .format() --play ground only support it
print("the {} is ).format(sth)


first = "Colt"
last = "Steele"

formatted = "First Name: {}, Last Name: {}". format(first, last) #可以直接在string 后加

5.is vs ==
is check with the memory and == checks value
is--checking equality
 a = 1
 a == 1 #True
 a is 1 #True
  
 a = [1,2,3]
 b = [1,2,3]
 a == b #True
 a is b #Flase, they are different objects 
 c = b
 b is c #True, b and c are pointing to the same stuff
 
 a = 13
 b = 13
 a == b #True
 a is b #True
 
6. use # for comments in python
''' for python  multiple line comments

7. python use indent to distinguish block, which is 4 spaces, it is better to use space than tab, to avoid difference between different editors

8. python 里的print（） 有自动换行功效
