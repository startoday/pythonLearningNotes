1.list
[] tells python it is a list, seperate by ","
it can contain any type in the same list

demo_list = ["a", 1, 45.7, True]  #no error!

use len funtion to check how many item is in the list

len(demo_list) #4

#another way to build a list -- list() function
tasks = list(range(1,4))

2.access value in list
list always start counting at zero
friends = ["AZ", "Dood"]
print(friends[0]) # AZ
print(friends[3]) # error, list index out of range
print(friends[-1) # AZ negative value also work! 倒着数！，-1和0是一样的
>>> "Az" in friends
# True 可以check是不是在list里
 
 
 code people[-1][0]=="A"  not working, because in Python, strings are immutable;Basically, an object that is immutable cannot be modified once it is created unlike lists which are "mutable".
