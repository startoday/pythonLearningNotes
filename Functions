1.what is a function?
- a process for executing a task, reusable
- useful for re-act similar stuff

#stay DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself!
(WET - write everything twice)

#*Abstract away* code for other users

2.function structure
def name_of_function():
  #block of runnable code
 
def say_hi():
	print("what is your name?")
	name = input()
	print(f"hi,  {name}")

say_hi()

def sing_happy_birthday():
	print("Happy birthday to you")
	print("Happy birthday to you")
	print("Happy birthday dear you")
	print("Happy birthday to you")

for i in range(2,4):
	sing_happy_birthday()
	
	
3. return value for functions
#return will exit the function, anthing after return won't be touched
#return will outputs whatever value is placed after the return keyword
#return pops the function off of the call stack

def square_of_7():
	return 7**2

result = square_of_7()
print(result)
