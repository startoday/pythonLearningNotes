1.Some data types:
bool (True, False, the first case has to be capital)
int 
str (a sequence of Unicode chars， “ ” or ‘’)
list（an ordered sequence of values of other data types [1,2,3]) 
dict ( a collection of key: values e.g. {"first_name":"Le", "last_name": "Lei"}


2. Dynamic typing
you can reassign variables to different types
dynamic typing vs statically-typed(variables are stuck with their originally-assigned types)


3. None (case sensitive!)
(python version of NULL)
can set new stuff with None if we haven't assign it 
(want a container, but nothing here, and the type of None is Nonetype--only itself)
