1. Tuple!
an ordered collection or grouping of items
--immutable!ÔºÅ list is mutable!

nums = (1,2,3,4)
print(type(nums)) #<class 'tuple'>
print(3 in nums) #True
# nums[0] = "change!"  #error 'tuple' object does not support item assignment

2.why use a tuple?
--tuples are faster than lists  -- such as months in a year
--it makes your code safer
--valid keys in a dictionary --- .items() return a tuple to you
