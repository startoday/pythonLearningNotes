1. conditional statements

if name == "tony stark :
  use indent to distinguish
  print("you are Iron Man")
elif name == "Peter Parker":  #you can have multiple elif, but only one else
  print("you are Spider Man")
elif name == "Natasha":
  print("you are Black Widom")
elif name == "Thor":
  print("you are Thor")
else :
  print("you are Norm Man")
------
#这种没有之后的内容（indent的话会报错）
if name == "tony stark :
print("you are Iron Man")


2. Truthiness
things are natually false: empty objects, empty strings, None, and zero

animal = input("say sth)
if animal:   #没有input时自动不会做这些
  print("you said sth)
  
  == test if they have the same value
  
  "A" < "a" # yep
  
  logical operators:
  and, or(binary), not(unary)
  
  age > 2 and age < 8
  if not isWeekend():
    do th
  
3.is vs ==
is check with the memory and == checks value
is--checking equality
 a = 1
 a == 1 #True
 a is 1 #True
  
 a = [1,2,3]
 b = [1,2,3]
 a == b #True
 a is b #Flase, they are different objects 
 c = b
 b is c #True, b and c are pointing to the same stuff
 
 a = 13
 b = 13
 a == b #True
 a is b #True
